        <h2><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/ENIAC">ENIAC</a></h2>
        <p class="description">
            ENIAC (or Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first programmable general-purpose electronic digital computer. Physicist John Mauchly, engineer J Presper Eckert, Jr., and their colleagues at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania led a project to build an all-electronic computer, funded by the US government. Work began in early 1943, John von Neumann was frequently consulted during this project. Because of its reliance on plugboards, ENIAC’s biggest flaw at the time was the time it took to reprogram it for different types of problems, sometimes taking days. Though that also introduced its greatest strength, when programmed correctly, it could run at electronic speed. ENIAC was prized for its introduction of electrical engineering to calculate data, it helped introduce significantly more flexibility into computer design. It was completed in 1946, after the war it was meant for had been won, though it still was useful for the calculations to construct the hydrogen bomb. ENIAC's design was intrumental into the transition to electrical engineering in our modern computers.

        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_ACE">Pilot ACE</a></h2>
        <p class="description">
            Pilot ACE was a cut down version of Turing’s full ACE design. Turing himself left the project after being disillusioned with the lack of progress. James H. Wilkinson then took over the project, while Donald Davies, Harry Huskey, and Mike Woodger were involved in the design. Its first program ran in May 1950, and it was first demonstrated to the press in November 1950. It entered service in late 1951, as its ability to perform floating-point arithmetic was necessary for scientific calculations. This computing engine was instrumental in forming how modern computers work today.Pilot ACE used approximately 800 vacuum tubes. Its main memory consisted of mercury delay lines with an original capacity of 128 words of 32 bits each, which was later expanded to 352 words. A 4096-word drum memory was added in 1954. Its basic clock rate, 1 megahertz, was the fastest of the early British computers.

        <h2><a href="https://history-computer.com/macintosh-by-apple-complete-history-of-mac-computers/">Apple's Macintosh</a></h2>
        <p class="description">
            The Macintosh was somewhat revolutionary for its time. It was the first personal computer to successfully include two features: the mouse and the graphical user interface. It was designed as a low-cost computer that allowed more people to afford it. In the project, the constraints of keeping the computer itself cheaper led to the design of new parts that didn’t cost nearly as much as higher-end computer parts did. This helped to spread the use of computers and advance their evolution into what we now know today.

        <p class="description">
            Originally designed to meet the automated information-sharing needs of scientists and institutions around the world, the World Wide Web (WWW) has revolutionized how computers work. The design allowed easy access to information from around the world. The spread of this idea caused a massive uprising of computer use for more than just scientific study. Since then, it has developed into an instant way to access nearly any information you can imagine.

        <p class="description">
            Broadband internet was designed to replace dial-up, as it was significantly faster and could transport more information without sacrificing much speed. It also didn’t need to be activated or deactivated, it could whenever any time it was needed. Fibre optic wires also improved these speeds tremendously.
